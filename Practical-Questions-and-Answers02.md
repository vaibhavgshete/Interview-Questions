### **GitLab VCS Questions**

1. **What is GitLab, and how does it differ from GitHub?**
   
   - **Answer:** GitLab is a complete DevOps platform that provides a Git-based 
     repository manager, CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, monitoring, and 
     more. Unlike GitHub, which primarily focuses on source code management 
     and collaboration, GitLab offers an all-in-one solution for the entire 
     software development lifecycle. GitLab includes built-in CI/CD, 
     container registry, and Kubernetes integration, whereas GitHub relies on
     third-party tools or GitHub Actions for similar functionality.

2. **What is a GitLab repository?**
   
   - **Answer:** A GitLab repository is a storage space where your project’s code, 
     files, and version history are stored. It uses Git for version control, 
     allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the same project. 
     Repositories can be public or private, and they support features like 
     branching, merging, and tagging.

3. **Explain the Git workflow in GitLab.**
   
   - **Answer:** The Git workflow in GitLab typically follows these steps:
     
     1. **Clone the repository:** Developers clone the repository to their local machine.
     
     2. **Create a branch:** A new branch is created for a feature or bug fix.
     
     3. **Make changes:** Developers make changes to the code and commit them to the branch.
     
     4. **Push changes:** The branch is pushed to the remote repository.
     
     5. **Create a Merge Request (MR):** A Merge Request is created to merge the changes into the main branch.
     
     6. **Code review:** Team members review the code, provide feedback, and approve the MR.
     
     7. **Merge:** Once approved, the branch is merged into the main branch.
     
     8. **Delete the branch:** The feature branch is deleted to keep the repository clean.

4. **What is a Merge Request (MR) in GitLab?**
   
   - **Answer:** A Merge Request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another (e.g., a feature branch into `main`).
     It allows for code review, discussions, and automated testing before 
     merging. MRs are a key part of collaborative development, ensuring that 
     changes are reviewed and tested before being integrated into the main 
     codebase.

5. **How do you resolve merge conflicts in GitLab?**
   
   - **Answer:** Merge conflicts occur when two branches have changes in the same part of a file. To resolve them:
     
     1. Pull the latest changes from the target branch (e.g., `main`).
     
     2. Open the conflicting file(s) and manually resolve the conflicts.
     
     3. Mark the conflicts as resolved using `git add <file>`.
     
     4. Commit the changes and push the branch.
     
     5. Complete the Merge Request in GitLab.

6. **What is a GitLab fork?**
   
   - **Answer:** A fork is a personal copy of another user’s repository. It allows you 
     to make changes without affecting the original project. Forks are 
     commonly used in open-source projects, where contributors fork a 
     repository, make changes, and submit Merge Requests to propose changes 
     back to the original repository.

7. **What are GitLab protected branches?**
   
   - **Answer:** Protected branches restrict who can push, merge, or delete branches. They are often used for critical branches like `main` or `production` to prevent accidental changes. For example, you can configure a 
     protected branch to allow only Maintainers to merge changes, ensuring 
     that only approved code is deployed.

8. **What is GitLab CI/CD?**
   
   - **Answer:** GitLab CI/CD is a built-in tool for continuous integration and 
     continuous deployment. It automates the process of testing, building, 
     and deploying applications. CI/CD pipelines are defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which specifies the stages, jobs, and scripts to run.

9. **What is a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file?**
   
   - **Answer:** The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is a configuration file that defines the CI/CD pipeline. It specifies the stages (e.g., `build`, `test`, `deploy`), jobs, and scripts to run for automation. For example:
     
     yaml
     
     Copy
     
     stages:
     
     - build
     - test
     - deploy
     
     build_job:
      stage: build
      script:
     
     - echo "Building the application..."
     
     test_job:
      stage: test
      script:
     
     - echo "Running tests..."
     
     deploy_job:
      stage: deploy
      script:
     
     - echo "Deploying to production..."

10. **What are GitLab runners?**
    
    - **Answer:** GitLab runners are agents that execute the jobs defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. They can be shared across projects or specific to a project. 
      Runners can be installed on various platforms (e.g., Linux, Windows, 
      macOS) and can run jobs in different environments (e.g., Docker, 
      Kubernetes, shell).

### **GitLab CI/CD Questions**

21. **What are the stages in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline?**
    
    - **Answer:** Stages define the sequence of jobs in a pipeline. Common stages include:
    
    - **build:** Compile or build the application.
    
    - **test:** Run unit tests, integration tests, etc.
    
    - **deploy:** Deploy the application to a staging or production environment.
    
    - **release:** Publish the application (e.g., Docker images, npm packages).

22. **What is a job in GitLab CI/CD?**
    
    - **Answer:** A job is a set of instructions defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that runs scripts, commands, or tests. Jobs are grouped into stages and executed by GitLab runners. For example:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy
    
    build_job:
      stage: build
      script:
    
        - echo "Building the application..."

23. **What is the difference between `only` and `except` in GitLab CI/CD?**
    
    - **Answer:** `only` specifies when a job should run (e.g., only on specific branches), while `except` specifies when a job should not run. For example:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy
    
    deploy_job:
      stage: deploy
      script:
    
        - echo "Deploying to production..."
    
      only:
    
        - main

24. **What are artifacts in GitLab CI/CD?**
    
    - **Answer:** Artifacts are files generated during a job (e.g., logs, binaries) that 
      can be passed to subsequent jobs or downloaded after the pipeline 
      completes. For example:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy
    
    build_job:
      stage: build
      script:
    
        - echo "Building the application..."
    
      artifacts:
    
        paths:
          - build/

25. **What is caching in GitLab CI/CD?**
    
    - **Answer:** Caching stores files (e.g., dependencies) between pipeline runs to speed up job execution. For example:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy
    
    build_job:
      stage: build
      script:
    
        - echo "Building the application..."
    
      cache:
    
        paths:
          - node_modules/
