## Technical Questions

### 1. Spring Boot and REST APIs

#### Q: Can you explain how you developed the System of Records (SOR) application using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL? What challenges did you face?

**A:**  
The System of Records (SOR) application was designed to manage application environments, artifactory, systems, and states. Here's how I approached it:

- **Tech Stack:**  
  
  - **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)  
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL  
  - **APIs:** RESTful APIs  

- **Key Features:**  
  
  - REST APIs for CRUD operations on environments, systems, and states.  
  - PostgreSQL for storing relational data like environment configurations, system details, and state transitions.  
  - Spring Data JPA for database interactions.  

- **Challenges and Solutions:**  
  
  - **Challenge 1:** Data consistency across multiple environments.  
    - **Solution:** Implemented transactional management using `@Transactional` annotations to ensure atomicity.  
  - **Challenge 2:** Handling large datasets efficiently.  
    - **Solution:** Used pagination and indexing in PostgreSQL to optimize query performance.  
  - **Challenge 3:** Securing REST APIs.  
    - **Solution:** Integrated Spring Security for authentication and authorization.  

- **Outcome:**  
  
  - Reduced manual intervention by 80% by automating environment and system management.

#### Q: How do you handle exception handling and validation in Spring Boot REST APIs?

**A:**  
Exception handling and validation are critical for building robust APIs. Here's how I handle them:

- **Exception Handling:**  
  
  - Use `@ControllerAdvice` to create a global exception handler.  
  
  - Define custom exceptions (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException`) and handle them in the advice class.  
  
  - Example:  
    
    ```java
    @ControllerAdvice
    public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
        @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
        public ResponseEntity<String> handleResourceNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>(ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }
    ```

- **Validation:**  
  
  - Use `@Valid` annotation to validate request bodies.  
  
  - Define validation constraints using annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.  
  
  - Example:  
    
    ```java
    public class User {
        @NotNull
        private String name;
    
        @Size(min = 5, max = 15)
        private String password;
    }
    ```

### 2. CI/CD and DevOps

#### Q: Can you explain your experience with CI/CD automation using GitLab and Jenkins?

**A:**  
I have extensive experience in implementing CI/CD pipelines for Java Spring Boot applications. Here's how I did it:

- **Tools Used:**  
  
  - **GitLab:** For source code management and CI/CD pipelines.  
  - **Jenkins:** For automating build and deployment processes.  
  - **SonarQube:** For code quality checks.  
  - **Nexus:** For artifact management.  

- **Pipeline Steps:**  
  
  1. **Build:** Compile the code and run unit tests.  
  2. **Test:** Run integration tests and generate test reports.  
  3. **Code Quality Check:** Use SonarQube to analyze code quality.  
  4. **Deploy:** Deploy the application to staging/production environments.  

- **Outcome:**  
  
  - Reduced deployment time by 60%.  
  - Improved code quality and reliability.

#### Q: How did you reduce deployment time for Oracle Siebel by 75%?

**A:**  
I automated the deployment process for Oracle Siebel using GitLab, shell scripting, and Java utilities. Here's how:

- **Steps:**  
  
  1. Created a Java Utility to automate data operations (import, export, and data loading).  
  2. Wrote shell scripts to handle deployment tasks like starting/stopping servers and deploying artifacts.  
  3. Integrated GitLab CI/CD pipelines to trigger deployments automatically.  

- **Outcome:**  
  
  - Reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 20 minutes.  
  - Eliminated manual errors and improved deployment efficiency.

### 3. Docker and Kubernetes

#### Q: How did you use Docker and Kubernetes in your projects?

**A:**  
I used Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. Here's how:

- **Docker:**  
  
  - Created Docker images for Spring Boot applications.  
  
  - Example Dockerfile:  
    
    ```dockerfile
    FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
    COPY target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar
    EXPOSE 8080
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/myapp.jar"]
    ```

- **Kubernetes:**  
  
  - Wrote Kubernetes manifest files for deploying applications.  
  
  - Example Deployment YAML:  
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: spring-boot-app
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: spring-boot-app
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: spring-boot-app
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: spring-boot-app
            image: myapp:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
    ```

- **Outcome:**  
  
  - Achieved 50% faster deployment times.  
  - Improved scalability and reliability.

public Product getProduct(@PathVariable Long id) {
    return productService.findById(id);
}

@PutMapping("/{id}")
public Product updateProduct(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Product product) {
    return productService.update(id, product);
}

@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
