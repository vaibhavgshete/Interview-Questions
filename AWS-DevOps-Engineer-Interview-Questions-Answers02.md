# AWS DevOps Engineer Interview Questions & Answers

## AWS Questions

### 1. What is AWS and how does it support DevOps?

**Answer:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides on-demand computing resources, storage, networking, and other cloud services. AWS supports DevOps by offering tools like AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodeCommit, which streamline automation, deployment, and infrastructure management. AWS also provides auto-scaling, monitoring (CloudWatch), and security (IAM) features to optimize DevOps workflows.

### 2. What is AWS CodePipeline and how does it work?

**Answer:** AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed CI/CD service that automates code build, test, and deployment. It integrates with Git repositories, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy to create end-to-end deployment pipelines. CodePipeline uses stages and actions to define workflow steps, enabling fast and reliable software delivery.

### 3. What is AWS CodeBuild and how does it work?

**Answer:** AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts. It eliminates the need to manage and scale build servers. CodeBuild integrates seamlessly with AWS CodePipeline and supports build specifications through `buildspec.yml` files.

### 4. What is AWS CodeDeploy and how does it support DevOps?

**Answer:** AWS CodeDeploy automates application deployments to EC2 instances, on-premises servers, and Lambda functions. It supports rolling, blue/green, and canary deployments, reducing downtime and ensuring reliable software releases. CodeDeploy also integrates with AWS CodePipeline and other CI/CD tools.

### 5. What is AWS CodeCommit, and how does it compare to GitLab or GitHub?

**Answer:** AWS CodeCommit is a fully managed Git-based repository service that securely stores source code. It integrates with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control and AWS CodePipeline for automation. Compared to GitLab or GitHub, CodeCommit offers native AWS integration but lacks some advanced DevOps features like GitLab CI/CD.

### 6. How does AWS CloudFormation support Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

**Answer:** AWS CloudFormation allows infrastructure to be defined as code using YAML or JSON templates. It automates provisioning and management of AWS resources, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort. CloudFormation supports stack creation, updates, and rollback capabilities.

### 7. What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk and how does it simplify deployments?

**Answer:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that automates application deployment, scaling, and management. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates with AWS services like RDS, S3, and IAM. Developers can deploy applications using the Beanstalk console, CLI, or APIs.

### 8. How does AWS Lambda support serverless DevOps workflows?

**Answer:** AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events. It eliminates infrastructure management, automatically scales, and supports event-driven automation in CI/CD workflows. Lambda integrates with AWS services like S3, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

### 9. What are EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and how do they work?

**Answer:** EC2 Auto Scaling Groups automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand. ASGs ensure high availability and cost optimization by scaling in and out based on metrics from CloudWatch alarms.

### 10. What is AWS CloudWatch and how does it help in monitoring?

**Answer:** AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service that collects logs, metrics, and events. It provides real-time insights into application and infrastructure performance. CloudWatch Alarms trigger automated responses, such as scaling EC2 instances or notifying DevOps teams.

## Docker Questions

### 11. What is Docker and why is it used in DevOps?

**Answer:** Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications to be packaged with their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Docker enables DevOps teams to standardize environments, improve application scalability, and streamline deployments across different platforms. Containers ensure consistency between development, testing, and production.

### 12. What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?

**Answer:** A **Docker image** is a pre-built, immutable template containing application code and dependencies. A **Docker container** is a running instance of an image. Images serve as blueprints, while containers are executable environments derived from images.

### 13. What is Docker Compose and how does it work?

**Answer:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`). It allows services, networks, and volumes to be configured and started with a single command (`docker-compose up`).

### 14. What is the purpose of a Dockerfile?

**Answer:** A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, dependencies, configurations, and commands to run the application. The `docker build` command processes the Dockerfile to generate an image.

### 15. What is Docker Networking and what types exist?

**Answer:** Docker networking enables communication between containers and external systems. The main types are:

- **Bridge** – Default network for container communication on the same host.
- **Host** – Removes network isolation and uses the host’s network stack.
- **Overlay** – Enables multi-host networking in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
- **Macvlan** – Assigns a MAC address to containers for direct network access.

### 16. How does Docker Volume help in data persistence?

**Answer:** Docker Volumes store persistent data independent of the container lifecycle. This allows data to be retained even if the container is stopped or removed. Volumes improve performance and are managed outside of the container filesystem.

## Kubernetes Questions

### 17. What is Kubernetes and how does it help DevOps?

**Answer:** Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates container deployment, scaling, and management. It helps DevOps teams efficiently run containerized applications across clusters. Kubernetes ensures high availability, load balancing, self-healing, and declarative configuration through YAML files.

### 18. What are Kubernetes Pods?

**Answer:** A Kubernetes **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit that can contain one or more containers. Pods share networking and storage resources, making them ideal for running closely related application components. Each Pod runs on a Kubernetes node and can be scheduled dynamically.

### 19. What is a Kubernetes Deployment?

**Answer:** A Kubernetes Deployment manages the rollout and scaling of Pods. It defines the desired state of an application and ensures updates are deployed safely. Deployments use ReplicaSets to maintain the desired number of running instances.

### 20. How does Kubernetes Service work?

**Answer:** A Kubernetes Service provides stable networking for Pods. It abstracts Pod IPs and enables external or internal communication. Service types include:

- **ClusterIP** – Internal service accessible within the cluster.
- **NodePort** – Exposes service on a static port on each node.
- **LoadBalancer** – Integrates with cloud providers to create external load balancers.

### 21. What is a Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secret?

**Answer:** ConfigMaps and Secrets store configuration data for Kubernetes applications. ConfigMaps hold non-sensitive settings, while Secrets store sensitive data like credentials and API keys, keeping them encrypted and secure.

### 22. What is Helm in Kubernetes?

**Answer:** Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deployment and management of applications. Helm Charts define reusable Kubernetes configurations, making deployments more efficient and maintainable.

### 23. What is the role of Ingress in Kubernetes?

**Answer:** Kubernetes Ingress manages external access to services within the cluster. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and routing rules, allowing better control over incoming traffic.
