# AWS VPC Peering Scenarios

## **Scenario 1: Basic VPC Peering Setup**

- Two VPCs (`VPC1` and `VPC2`) are peered.
- Route tables are updated for **both VPCs** to allow communication.
- **Result:** EC2 instances in both VPCs can communicate.

---

## **Scenario 2: One-Way Route Table Update**

- Peering is established.
- **Only `VPC1`'s route table is updated** to allow traffic to `VPC2`.
- **Result:**
  - ✅ **EC2 in VPC1 can send traffic to VPC2.**
  - ❌ **EC2 in VPC2 cannot respond because its route table is not updated.**
  - **Ping fails** since ICMP requires a response.

---

## **Scenario 3: Multiple Subnets, Single Route Table per VPC**

- Each VPC has **two subnets**.
- **One route table per VPC** (shared by all subnets) is updated for peering.
- **Result:** Any EC2 in `VPC1` can communicate with any EC2 in `VPC2`.

---

## **Scenario 4: Multiple Subnets, Separate Route Tables**

- Each VPC has **two subnets**, each with its own route table.
- Peering connection is set up.

### **Case 4A: Only One Subnet Route Table Updated**

- **Only `rt1a` (VPC1) is updated to allow peering.**
- **Result:**
  - ✅ `subnet1a` (VPC1) → `subnet2a` (VPC2) **works** (one-way communication).
  - ❌ `subnet1a` (VPC1) cannot receive a response from `subnet2a` (VPC2).
  - ❌ `subnet1b` (VPC1) **cannot communicate** with `subnet2a` or `subnet2b`.

### **Case 4B: Route Tables for Both Peered Subnets Updated**

- `rt1a` (VPC1) and `rt2a` (VPC2) are updated.
- **Result:**
  - ✅ `subnet1a` (VPC1) ↔ `subnet2a` (VPC2) **bidirectional communication works**.
  - ❌ `subnet1b` and `subnet2b` remain isolated.

### **Case 4C: Full VPC Communication**

- Route tables `rt1a`, `rt1b`, `rt2a`, and `rt2b` are all updated.
- **Result:** Now **all subnets can communicate across both VPCs**.

## **One-Way Communication Without Response**

✅ If a request **does not require a response**, it will work:

- **Logging (syslog, CloudWatch metrics)**
- **UDP-based telemetry** (e.g., IoT, VoIP)
- **Unacknowledged HTTP requests (fire-and-forget)**

❌ If a response **is required**, communication will fail unless return routes are set up:

- **Ping (ICMP needs a reply)**
- **SSH (TCP handshake needs response)**
- **Normal HTTP requests (expects a response)**

---

## **Final Summary**

| Scenario    | Communication Between                     | Works? |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Scenario 1  | Any EC2 in VPC1 ↔ VPC2                    | ✅ Yes  |
| Scenario 2  | VPC1 → VPC2 (One-way)                     | ✅ Yes  |
| Scenario 2  | VPC2 → VPC1 (Response)                    | ❌ No   |
| Scenario 3  | All Subnets in VPC1 ↔ All Subnets in VPC2 | ✅ Yes  |
| Scenario 4A | `subnet1a` (VPC1) → `subnet2a` (VPC2)     | ✅ Yes  |
| Scenario 4A | `subnet1b` (VPC1) → `subnet2a`/`subnet2b` | ❌ No   |
| Scenario 4B | `subnet1a` ↔ `subnet2a` (Bidirectional)   | ✅ Yes  |
| Scenario 4C | Any EC2 in VPC1 ↔ Any EC2 in VPC2         | ✅ Yes  |

🚀 **With correct route updates, full VPC-to-VPC communication can be achieved!**
